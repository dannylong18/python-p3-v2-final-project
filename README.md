# Phase 3 CLI+ORM Final Project

# Name - MD Database

## Description

This is a very simple command line interface (CLI) built using python & SQL utilizing ORM classes/methods. It was created to simulate a doctor's office that uses a CLI to manage its patients and treatments. For these purposes, it is assumed that a doctor's office has many patients; and they can only undergo a single treatment at a time. Therefore, it utilizes a one-to-many relationship with the treatments/patients, respectively. 
The patient and treatment classes contain each contain mulitple properties and instance/class methods to help with the CLI function. As a user, you are able to accomplish many tasks such as: listing all the current patients/treatments, updating patients/treatments, deleting patients/treatments, and seeing which patients are associated with a particular treatment.
